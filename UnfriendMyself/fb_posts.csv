"Against all statistics and everything I know to be true, I'm going to the Urgent Care to treat strep. To which, they will prescribe something in the penicillin family -- that will do nothing except slightly reduce the risk of a rare progression of strep to rheumatic fever. Ah, but the real reason is my desire that I get a 'loose' MD that will give me liquid codeine and prednisone so I can actually eat something -- an activity (eating) that might help me get better more quickly. Turns out, your body sucks at fighting things disease when it is malnourished... strep is really bad for eating and drinking."
"There is no silver lining to penicillin, and rheumatic fever is mostly for immune suppressed individuals. Penicillin is effectively the equivalent to water with all the over prescribing -- and it's step brother, amoxicillin, is also a waste of time. The only upside is the gamble of urgent care expenditure at the last minute of operation and me letting him/her prescribe piss water so I may then lecture him/her on nutrition and scoring something that allows me to get some fucking vegetable and fruit in my system. Also, this makes me sound like a douche, but I have some really awesome cheese that needs to be eaten at just the right time. Ain't nobody got time for this shit. 

I haven't eaten in two days, so I'm a little bitchy."
"Oh, and when the MD or the Internet tell you that strep isn't contagious 24 hours after you start an antibiotic, that is complete BS. You constantly have strep bacteria in your throat and mouth."
"Exactly"
"Not yet. The window is a week."
"I had not considered they were avoiding me. I assumed they were incompetent."
"Medical puzzle time for a friend. Female abruptly lost neurological sensation, bilaterally, on her entire body. No paralysis or loss of motor function present; take Bell's and Hemiplegia off the table. Symptoms stable over six day period. Complains of blurred vision over several years (may not be connected). Migraines frequent throughout life, no change in frequency. Clean CT, sans contrast, head and chest. No MRI performed. EKG normal, CBC all in normal range. I'm at Lupus or other pathogen (missed clues on CBC), mass or cyst on spine or head, or early onset MS. Other ideas? MD not helping her. Chalked it up to psychological."
"Ya, Sarah Murphy, I got hit with strep in 2010 and it weakened my immune system to allow methicillin-resistant staph (found on every piece of skin on your body) to infect my lungs (pneumonia) and my stomach. I was on two decent antibiotics + steroids, and after two days decided I had to go to the ER... with a 104+ fever, I 'logically' concluded that an ambulance ride was not economical and tried to drive myself (huge mistake). What I did find out through that adventure was that hospitals are holding certain forms of antibiotics back from mass consumption, glycopeptide/vancomycin and daptomycin. Because they are used rarely, they are very effective. I was put on IV antibiotics and was 99% better in 24 hours -- no shit. In fairness, I was in bad shape, but penicillin-based (and I fear also macrolide-based/azithromycin) antibiotics are essentially worthless nowadays. I am not kidding you, they do absolutely nothing -- all in your head. The resistance is somewhat localized, though. Individuals that take more antibiotics have higher resistant infections, but there is also a general mutation within the bacteria as whole -- effecting the population at large. It's bad, truly. Z-Packs were marketed so heavily off the freaking convenience of a 5-day antibiotic they largely made even clarithromycin worthless in 20% of infectious diseases. Listen, if we start over using the vancomycin or daptomycin families in mass, we're all screwed... no joke. We are out of options at that point. I'm far, far less concerned about viruses, like bird flu, than no treatment for staph bacterial infections. That would set medicine back 80 years."
"Let me qualify that statement before someone calls me on it. By taking antibiotics of the penicillin family, there is evidence that you will reduce secondary infections in other organs outside of the originating site. That said, you are playing a card between 1-2% of most general infections. But yes, playing the numbers, it will reduce your chances of a secondary at this very point in time. However, it will 100% fuck you in the future."
"Back up to the top, every study in the past ten years shows no evidence that amoxicillin/penicillin/β-lactam-based antibiotics improve the outcome or increase recovery for ANY infection of the throat, respiratory (lower/upper) or cranial systems. There is also a suspicious spike in colon cancer in the 60s and another in the early 70s, and it is fairly common knowledge that these antibiotics kill 'good' bacteria in your digestive track. Use your best judgement, but statistically, you're doing nothing positive."

"Ya, MD resisted the MRI (like always), but she's scheduled next week, pending pre-approval from insurance. No SED was done, she's still working the healthcare funnel process, so that would be post brain mass exclusion, in my opinion. The lack of muscular leans away from spinal condition. Stroke would have been my diagnosis of choice, but clean tests point to brain, unfortunately. Full bilateral is fairly rare without a muscular symptoms."
"MS is sometimes hard to diagnose because the symptoms are so broad, but I agree that early onset is a potential condition. That said, a mass in the brain would present the same way and depending on location and expansion would begin to show other symptoms."
"Courtney Metzger, best approach ever. Introduce me to a MD that knows anything about nutrition and I'll call bullshit. They aren't trained that way, and often any disease requires a three-prong approach (system, specialty and consumption). Being from the Midwest, this idea was foreign to me until last year."
"Definitely needs an MRI, but the MD was an ass about it, obviously. MS can originate and focus on the spine, which she's only getting head and neck next week."

Whatever the price was, I felt it was a little hefty for a giant waterfall (which are everywhere in Colorado... so, ya, little bummed about that). Rainbow Falls is there too (free), but they got rid of the graffiti... which is why it was called Rainbow Falls."

"Recruiters, you know what you do wrong? It's real simple. You call out of nowhere with tales of luxury and sex -- and marginalize my career as if I wave a magic wand at nothingness. 

I don't want to be sold on sex -- no one does. People say they do, but they really don't. Make someone fall in love, that's the secret. Paint a picture you can't possibly turn away from. Tell a story that someone can believe, and is true, and one where they imagine themselves playing a meaningful role as one of the characters. Sell the idea. 

Be better at your job. Stop talking about money and other bullshit -- all temporary. And, don't brag about how big the company is -- talk about the great culture and smart people. And if your client isn't great, why are you wasting everyone's time, including yours? Drop'em. 

On a related note, that recruiter probably won't call me again at 8:00 PM and interrupt an intense Starcraft league game. 

Additionally, Tulsa sounds terrible. You could have 70 virgins and pool filled with money and I still wouldn't give up this game I'm playing to chat."

"Nice job! Boulder hits #1 skinniest place in America for third year in a row. And, with Colorado Springs hitting the Top 10 list this year, that brings Colorado cities to a whopping 40% of the Top 10 in the USA (Denver, Boulder, FC, CS). 

One thing I'd add to the article is while it's true people are crazy healthy when it comes to food in Colorado (salad restaurants, gourmet salads, fish, fish tacos, fish grilled, fish, fish, more lettuce, tea, juice bars, fruits, more lettuce, etc), there is an aspect of 'play' that is the most extreme I've seen anywhere in this country. No one has ever asked me, ""Did you see [x] show last night?"" -- because no one was home, ever, on any night. Most days people are simply out and about. 

Generally speaking, not owning a couch and cable television will do wonders for your health. Only in Colorado have I seen a Twitter handle giving the congestion of parks for that hour. If you need proof, look no further than Estes Park in the summer -- while extremely beautiful, looks like an insane flashback to Woodstock (the real one) for weeks on end, with horses and hundreds of color-shaded tents saturating the mountain views. I think it looks like a chocolate sundae with sprinkles."
"No, Marc, that doesn't happen here. In fact, when it snows, which is more rare than STL, I have 24 hours to shovel the sidewalk and bike path (found on most streets) or I get a ticket -- because bikers honestly have way more rights than drivers here (there are pros and cons to that) and snow is a hazard to bikers. I haven't figured out why it is my responsibility vs the City, but it is what it is. If someone did that to me biking, my response would probably be, ""Where did you find that cheeseburger in this part of town?"" I bet you're wondering how I found out about the $50 ticket for not shoveling snow, right? Na, you guessed it; no shovel and pure laziness. And, I had no checks to pay the fine. You know what else you'll get a ticket for? Trash cans left out for 24 hours. Again, pedestrians and bikers. No complaints, but Colorado should come with user guide. Like pot is legal and easier to get than booze. And, don't be an idiot and climb that 14er because you will die. And, wear sunscreen every day. That's what I've learned so far. Oh, and at 160, I am very much considered overweight here. I saw a woman once that was 'Missouri overweight' and immediately wanted to help her leave the State as quickly as possible. I figured she somehow slipped passed the border control at Kansas. No, in seriousness, CO is pure awesomeness."

"Being a guy that lives in airports, and by proxy many different cities, Houston is not as nice as any Colorado city (in general). First, and most importantly, it is humid as all shit down there. Second, if you like life, you need to move to California. If you're not a multi-millionaire, move to Colorado. End of story."
"Live in NYC/Boston/DC long enough to be as crass and angry about everything as I am -- and then go some place and really enjoy it (Cali or CO)."
"Like I said, simple economics. If you're rich, move to Cali. If you don't care about money, move to Colorado. I mean, Houston has the Space Center, aquarium and a zoo. Ya, we got those, too (DIA counts as a space center) + mountains with snow on them + never rains + boating + hiking and then some. As a word of caution, the further West you get, the less and less they care about money (hippie). North and South, extremely conservative cowboy territory (which I like, but to each their own). Also, we have Norad and the secret government installation under DIA, so it's pretty safe place to be if the world blows up."

When I have these events (rarely) I must reject traditional psychology's explanation that it is simply a temporary glitch in the memory's translation of short to long-term mechanics in the brain. There is something more there and I have a hard time coming up with a differential. I suppose its just easier to accept it as a fluke that occurs in 90% of humans, but could it be that benign? And I don't mean that there is a ""higher"" explanation, but rather is it a consequence that supports a memory construct theory seen in post-traumatic stress syndrome?

I don't need, want or desire something that has no value to me. I did enjoy that you insist that you're a TV junkie and, additionally, rationalize that it's not reality television... just the really important shows like Bones and whatever other things that are shown after the crappy reality network slop. But no, don't worry about swaying my opinion, as it sounds like you recognize that it is shit, and there is little chance you could sell me on having another bill for something you're selling terribly as a bad habit and I know is worthless."
"But, if I may, let's play a game. Let's say you have Dish Network (pimping the Denver-based companies like you should), and it sets you back $80 a month ($960/yr). Now, let's suppose that out of all the really great stuff (not reality television) that you watch on a weekly basis, you really like four or five shows. Let's also assume those shows have a normal run period of 12-14 episodes over four months, and that those shows could be found online (spoiler, they can). So, we'll say that equates to 48-54 hours of television a year. My guess is that you are spending between 3-5 hours a day watching less than your greatest desired shows -- about 1,100 combined total hours a year on the conservative side, leaving a 1,052 hour disparity on the light side. Let's say that you decided to not pay that bill and watch the shows you really like and pick up one (1) hour a week of profit (52 hours a year)... whatever it is you do. Let's say it pays less than super at $13/hr. I believe we're at $1,636/yr with 1,000 hours freed up. So, my question is really: are those less desirable hours worth not taking a $1,636 vacation (worst case scenario) this year? Because if so, I have a unique opportunity to acquire some oils from Rome I'd like to sell you... you can keep the 1,000 hours."

"So, Denver is 100% credit card based meter parking. Turns out, their margins took a hit with transaction percentage from the card companies. So, logically, they upped the parking fine. Last week, four minutes late cost me $50 for an expired meter. This week, downtown raised to a $100 fine. In fairness, everyone should take mass transit or ride their bike, but I'd like to point out that my parking fine in Manhattan was $65. $100 is pretty hefty. Also, they are installing sensors on Blake St as a test. Essentially, if your car hasn't moved and the meter expires, your credit card gets $100 hit on it, so no meter maids. I think it's great D is anti-car, and I embrace it, but those are some serious consequences for parking your car."

"In other news, Denmark approached the State of Colorado to advocate the international importation of marijuana... not a typo... Colorado to Denmark.

Frontier, get on this (internationalize and buy some 767s quickly). Best part, it turns out, they are willing to be taxed on the purchase at the same Colorado excise as tobacco, which is currently too low in my opinion (have you been to the state of New York).

"Data. It's fun, isn't it? It can be twisted to any benefit. This is not my hating on St. Louis at all; I love St. Louis and there are some extremely talented tech people in the area. However, the US Bureau of Labor says the actual growth of high-tech in St. Louis over Austin is 2%, in favor of STL -- with Boeing being the predominant cause in growth and Dell being the root of Austin's deceleration. So, if all acceleration/deceleration is static, according to the US Bureau of Labor, St. Louis will surpass Nashville in tech jobs in 2031 and Austin 2084 within ""high-tech"" density of jobs related to population. Both Seattle and Denver should expect competition from St. Louis in 2099 and 2097, respectively. Growth is good. Density is better. For example, on Dice alone, St. Louis has 22% the number of job postings of Denver and 32% of Austin. Careful on the stats, some of us will call bullshit on you (considering the data is publicly available)."
"That's definitely not true in my job (skew numbers for self-benefit), but I think that globally depends on the objective, so I get what you're saying. However, if your company is focused on a revenue growth KPI, as opposed to brand awareness or a brand development index, there is an underlining reality and truth to that statistic or number. People will play with a financial statistic (and all numbers) using backdoor acronyms, such as ACE or ACV for accounting, but there is transparency beneath it. However, yes, I think relating St. Louis to Austin in terms of tech jobs is complete rubbish. I'm happy to see growth for St. Louis in that area, but the comparisons made are buzz rhetoric. It borders on comparing a foot traffic increase at a local coffee shop to Starbucks."

"It took long enough, but it is conclusive: Facebook is slipping. I'm astonished by this because they do, despite my criticism, make an amazing product, to which they are constantly becoming more ingrained in my daily life. 

Two weeks ago, someone asked me what was the greatest technology to come out of the past decade (fully expecting me to say the iPhone, iPad or some popular .com that blesses our lives) and I responded OpenGraph (crickets). 

Ross jokes about it in his resignation and Facebook admits to it, but the mass departure of teens on Facebook is a serious, but predictable, problem. The minute your parents and grandparents are using a platform, it immediately becomes ""uncool"" and that's a bigger blow than Facebook is giving credit (publicly at least). 

But, like most, I'm surprised it took this long to publicly recognize, and until now, Facebook has been buying its teen numbers by acquiring companies like Instagram and the like -- holding on dearly to the idea that they can acquire their audience (at least that's what I heard in the 10-k report). 

Now, you have anyone from Forbes to BI predicting a gradual, but imminent failure in Facebook. I disagree, but I'm also not buying stock (for different reasons). Facebook is destined to be relevant for quite a while and teens simply hate anything their parents like, but I wouldn't bank that we aren't witnessing the possible gap for a new social platform (a real one)."

It also means that there is apparently an opening for VP of Product at Facebook, for ya'll really smart folk."
"I'm not sure I agree with that entirely, but definitely a conversation best had offline -- because one thing Facebook is not, is a place to discuss consumer journeys and retention on marketing dollars. But in short, I'm 100% sure Ross is specifically talking about the company's need to generate revenue and it operating as a display ad generator. You're talking on a different side of the fence where there is a strategy for a brand and someone is measuring engagement against that strategy, which to Ross' unspoken point, Facebook doesn't care about (and shouldn't), because you left them out out if picture. Now, if Facebook could figure out how to cut the agency out if mix, that would be a better mix for all parties (except the agency).

"Whoa, people really hate the PS4, and their arguments are valid if you thought there was going to be some great revolution in the category, but why would you? The biggest titles rollout on tablet or desktop, some commanding more dollars than Harry Potter. Listen, the console is dead for gaming. I'm not a gamer, so I'm interested in an interactive media hub. Thus far, Sony Playstation (and one of the micro Sony hubs) bless every room in my house with a TV in it. Because without argument, at the price of $150 and no cable bill, it handles media better than anything else, including Boxee. No other living room device, and I don't care how savvy you think you are with Windows Media Center and torrents, compares to the PS3. It is superior in every way to every other device. And companies are extremely active in building on the platform (Netflix, Vudu, HuffPo, etc). I have tried and eBay'ed every device out there. AppleTV is a joke and GoogleTV is worse (I was shocked too). All the Apple fans can hate me for that comment, but you know it's irrefutable. And, I have little doubt Apple and iOS could roll the entire console industry; I really do. But let's be honest, Apple has seen better days on the innovation side, and I go back to the ""I'll believe it when I see it"" -- and that hasn't happened yet. In fairness I will say, in two hours, Sony never showed the console and didn't really talk about their new IPTV network... so, there's that. Seriously, if you are playing some game and uploading video from some epic battle... I don't know you and... fuck, do something else. I'm sorry, that's lame. That's getting $500 from me?

"March 25th they're opening an Alamo Brewhouse Cinema down the street from me. I went to the one in Austin and thought it was cool. It's like an AMC, Buffalo Wild Wings and Schlafly  all got together and had sex."
"Hell yeah. Are you sick?"
"Oh, so annoyed with the new iTunes... words don't describe. You can't seem to do the most simplistic things."
"US Airways: ""Your flight got transferred to American. Go to that desk.""
American: ""Your flight has been transferred to United. Please go to that counter.""
United: ""We have no record of you being on this flight.""

And, this is why I fly Southwest."
"The good and the bad, but mostly good."
"@Southwest. So, here's an interesting fact. Southwest, I'm a huge fan. Also, I fly a lot. In the past four years, I averaged 1.7 flights per week. A large portion have been Southwest Airlines/AirTran. I have a RR account and I have a Southwest Credit Card. 

So, here's a not-so-fun fact: When you change, alter or cancel air travel, the default is ""Save these funds for future use,"" to which I do quite often, assuming a cleaning credit card statement. Now, the assumption, being logged in, using your credit card and having an RR account attached to both the card and the online account is that these funds will exist in my account -- at least, the verbiage implies such. The only way to get those funds is to search your e-mail for old confirmation numbers and insert those numbers (individually) when you check-out on another flight. Shocking. You have a hidden page I found that allows you to query old confirmation numbers to see if you have ""hidden"" credits. Nowhere are these funds visible or even attached to my account. 

Fun fact: I'll be flying free for the next year, but it required a spreadsheet to sort it out. 

I fly so much I assumed those dollars where going towards the new flights, and I'm willing to bet most others do as well. Southwest, how much do you make a year off this process? It must be by design. You make it nearly impossible to get the ""saved"" refund. It's not a technological obstacle, you could simply credit my account or RR -- or at the least make a note in my account that allows me to easily recall these funds that I manually have to put in."

"Very true."

"I just wish I knew what was going on before now, but that's totally my fault. I'm fairly terrible at organization."
"I don't mean to sound like a complete ass (you love when a status update starts that way, don't you?), but generally speaking, a large percentage of people I know (not all) break out into this general rule: more money = less intelligent. I draw this conclusion based on the observation that the smartest people I know are generally of lesser income than those I know to have far greater means. There are exceptions to this, obviously, but I hypothesize that at a level of insight, money becomes more irrelevant and (two) people with higher IQs generally have a greater attachment to selflessness -- otherwise known as the inability to attack others to gain achievement. I find that one's ability to detach from empathy in others' lives, means a greater success in the business world -- generally speaking. In fairness, this depends on how you measure intelligence. Arguably, being able to maneuver and manipulate is a skill set into its own, and is definitive, in ways, and measurable, in other ways, within a broad spectrum of intelligence. This could be a complete falsehood (I'm heavily intoxicated), but I noticed that trend when going through my LinkedIn account this evening. The people I value for intelligence have not the money, nor the desire to obtain it. I find that odd. It is also completely conceivable that my definition of intelligence is skewed and aloof from traditional characteristics; this is of far greater likelihood. This would lead to the belief that those I value on that scale simply aren't marketable in any static sense. I find myself pondering this on a Friday night; a life without crassus or lewdness, but rather simply arbitrary thoughts of little weight."
"Some modest amounts of wealth do bring stability, which lessens stress and creates happier lives. Since I've known the fear of paying for simple things like a dentist and an oil change (dreading the possibility of something serious happening), I can attest that money will bring comfort -- and not worrying about such things is happiness to me. Wealth is loosely defined, though. I hear of people making $300k a year and believe them to rich beyond my dreams -- but those demanding seven-figures view $300k as barebones; so it's contextual, I suppose."

"""Dear friends, I'm doing well. I'm planning a beech party so we can play. It'll be like a play date. My mommy is getting me a bag, and a beech towel, and sand toys and a pink lunch box... with mermaids on it with black hair. We will have life preservers, so no one's mommies or daddies need to worry. When the sun is hot, we'll need sun glasses and hats. My hat will be pink and have mermaids. My brother, Isaac, will have a surfboard with Ninja Turtles on it. If someone can bring a big, huge umbrella so that we can all fit under it. We also need a dog and a cat. It'll be super fun. My daddy is writing this. L-E-X-I; that's how you can find me. Don't forget swimsuits and sunscreen -- and don't get it in your eyes because it'll burn. I'm drawing this today and sending it to everyone. Oh, I almost forgot, we need a table and chairs."""

"I love Texas, and you guys are far too modest at your own awesomeness. In contrast, Colorado, one of my favorite states, shouts it from the rooftop about being great... and they are. From Houston to Austin to El Paso to San Antonio, I'm a huge Texas fan and love the modesty. A tad humid in places, but no one is perfect. "
"Ya, I honestly hate that state and can't figure out why it still exists. Shouldn't the 99% of Illinois that is junk just consume it and then file for bankruptcy? When Kentucky and Tennessee seem like paradise compared your state, you have a serious problem."
"You'd have about the same merit as the others. Except one, which was totally my fault and I paid for it."
"I'm not sure I agree with that. My life wasn't bad and being from Newburgh a small percentage of my life has nothing to do with me saying that I dislike the state as a whole. I, personally, don't care for it... and in fact Kentucky and Tennessee are favored for me, personally. Just because someone says they dislike something, doesn't mean you can jump their ass with a 'you grew up on the rich side of the train tracks' bullshit. My life was just fine, but what you described could be said for 38 of the 50 states. I disagree that Indiana is generally safe and actually Indianapolis is far more diverse than other cities its size. Actually, I just disagree with everything you said. A better argument is that the population has declined so much that the cost of living is very good throughout the state, but then I'd tell you that cost of living and desire to reside in the location are directly linked. Your context is, and only is, Indiana, and that's fine."
"I'm confused. I actually consider myself quite fortunate in many ways, and sheltered in other ways. I recognized that, disliked that, and left. You resided in Newburgh far longer than me. Sounds like we share the same opinion of the place. But, I digress, as I was referring to Indiana as a whole, not a place I attended high school briefly. And yes, I, personally, much prefer Kentucky and Tennessee over Indiana, but that's simply my interpretation of what I value in a geographic location."

You live mere minutes from the most polluted place on the planet, and you think it's OK to dig up dirt saturated with plutonium? That is a radioactive actinide metal and it is absolutely airborne. If you leave it alone, it is harmless, but you stir it up and you'll create an invisible cloud of particles that is extremely dangerous, especially downwind (Westminster, Superior, Boulder, etc). So, eat all the organic meat you want, you'll die of lung cancer in 10 years from the alpha radiation. This is serious stuff, not a matter of driving convenience. Do not touch that site!

"Hoping for a good ad day. So far Coke Chase = Awesome! VW = terrible, missed, pathetic, aloof from key buying audience; a serious fall from the Star Wars grace. The ""let's make boring awesome"" is a good old-time play, but the happiness mix made it diluted and mostly just awkward. Budweiser = Heart angle again, meh. I'll give props for taking the father emotion, mixed with a mature audience for a mature brand, but it's still Americana and cowboys; maybe they should have thrown a hard punch at craft beer, but whatever, I sound like a broken record every year. Overall, an improvement over last year's weirdness. A step up, still safe and very nicely positioned, just not a stampede of awesomeness the brand could yield. Audi = One of the best ads I've seen since Detroit; perfection. I loved the first :10 setup with the depressing, slow maneuver. Much love to Wieden + Kennedy and Venables Bell. Seriously, now I want an Audi. Total badass. Damn it, I want an Audi."

This has to be the work of Denuo. Great work, keep it real. You didn't showcase the product, features or spark any buying power. What a ridiculous piece of crap."

"The prevalence and rise of Modafinil shocks me... but shouldn't."
"Ah, but we are bound through a certain unnamed company... I suspect most require Google to translate the gibberish that falls from our mouths. I just saw a CNN story where a couple of Internet executives were praising nootropic and neurotransmitter drugs, when the talking head behind the desk said a recent study had found, ""... of those making $150,0000 - $250,000 a year, the saturation of Modafinil was 38%."" That is not an insignificant amount of people. I, personally, know many people bio-hacking on both Modafinil and Piracetam at the same time, often exceeding LD25. And let's be honest, they'll need other chemicals to get sleep at some point -- be it weeks later. There is absolute truth that nootropics increase cognitive reaction, raise your IQ and increase memory in ways that are hard to measure. The trouble is simply there is no line. Everyone wants to pop a pill and become smarter, so I have little doubt these drugs will become less like steroids for the brain and more like antibiotics (over-prescribed). There are actual sites dedicated to delivering scripts to recite to MDs so you leave with a specific nootropic."
"*** Disclaimer: I do not advocate the use of these drugs unless they are properly obtained by a medical professional. Both have availability online, but increasing dopamine in the brain is a potentially life-threatening action. There are many side effects; for example, it is believed that .93% of the population that takes Modafinil (used to treat narcolepsy) will develop Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), which carries a large mortality rate. And if you survive SJS, you'll wish you had not. Now, don't sue me."

"Selfishness is the persistence of all humanity. It is this perspective that distorts everything."
"Though, arguably, this would imply that selfishness would eradicate itself through evolutionary behaviors, like birth control usage. However, selfishness is a broad dissonance. There are some that view reproduction as a status, so it falls on both sides of the track."
"Ya, poor Yirmeyahu. The biggest failure of all prophets -- even by his own admission... and so says history. For a prophet, the man sure was desperately irrational and completely ineffective at actually being a messenger of G-d. The guy couldn't even follow the simple instruction of reframing from preaching to non-Jews. I, on the other hand, find no fault in the heart. The mind keeps all perception and is a product of its surroundings by way of influence. I'll actually recommend an old one, albeit not as classic as the Torah, but 'How to Win Friends and Influence People' is by far one the best lens into the human soul I've read. I hate the fact that it is labeled a ""self-help"" book, as many of his tactics (experiments), while simple, rely heavily on the idea that humans are merely needy dogs ready to be exploited for gain. And as inhuman as that may sound, there's an underlining truth to that concept. In fact, Carnegie lists selfishness as one the most simplistic exploitations to a person within an arsenal -- that predictively, if all variables are equal, a human will simply be forced to choose the option that benefits him or her personally, and therefore all situations are controllable provided you have enough time and pieces to create this distortion."
"Absolutely. I wasn't implying that one simple man is representative of a systemic failure within all humans. The point was he wasn't just a simple man, and as Jewish prophets go, he is a fairly bad choice to cite in most all cases -- because he literally failed at being a prophet in every way imaginable and then cried about it. 

Carnegie was a little more than a salesman and was grossly criticized back then for releasing a book that essentially claimed, I'm paraphrasing, that humans could be manipulated through expected response in much the same ways rats react to electrified cheese. 

I got lost on the anatomy metaphor, apologies (admittedly, this is rare for me). So, the brain and the heart are not at all interdependent, which make them awesomely cool functions of our physiology. They are, in every way, independent from one another, with the single exception that the brain, as far as we know, needs a blood supply to avoid cell death, which means that your left toe has the exact same dependency of the heart as your brain. The heart has its own pace-maker, clocking system and chemical intake (sometimes released from the brain -- like endorphins). If they were interdependent, lie detectors would be much easier to pass (happy thoughts). The brain may die and the heart will maintain its pulse without the brain being active or even present, and vise-versa (heart transplant). The physical organs have no direct connectivity. There are, of course, syndromes that exist in the brain that may impact the heart, though only indirectly, like encephalopathy, which may sometimes involve the chemical release of enzymes that have a negative impact on all organs, including the heart."
"Two words: artificial heart. There, I showed you a brain without a heart."
"Ya, but your argument applies the same way to a liver, just without some sort a metaphorical semantic."
"Oh, I'm not debating religion, G-d or anything spiritual, especially on Facebook. I simply stated your argument was based in a mirage  -- unable to transition outside of a visceral defense. I don't need proof of anything. A single human and all its anatomical complexities, sitting on a rock in space that is 1:1,000,000,000,000,000,000+ of the universe comprising of both matter and anti-matter that originated from something the size of a pea in a timeless vacuum and moving faster than we know how measure in physics... no, I'm not discussing religion or spirituality with anything as obtuse and narrow as we humans are.

I'll skip to the juicy part: Antibiotics are statistically useless to administer for sinus infections and bronchitis. But yet they represent 31% of all prescriptions. In fairness, prescribing antibiotics could prevent a rather serious brain abscess from the sinus infection, but your lifetime risk is .0031% at age 0. Just to put that in perspective, your lifetime risk of brain cancer .62% at age 0.

"Cancer; always on my mind (as many know) -- and 50% of the people this goes to will be diagnosed in their lifetime (gender aside). And, unfortunately, the survival odds have never increased (with the exception of a few primary locations). Not that I frequent the CBN or view them as a reputable source of medical informatics, but they loosely bring up a good point. Not that of Ketosis, but that there simply is no information or funding for this kind of treatment... because there is no money in it. The facts they present are completely based in fact, and long known, especially for professional fitness trainers when it comes to glucose absorption and processing of ketones. Cancer? No clue. In theory it works, but so does chemotherapy (in theory). Of the three different types of chemo, none of them work optimally. The reason we put things in terms of 5-year survival is because drugs like Methotrexate, Cisplatin and Taxol cause cancer. The incidence of a second cancer in five and ten years is hundreds of times greater for someone that has taken these medications. Long we all sit here reading statistics, licking the margins between the lines, but the truth is a statical lie of cure rates. They remain unchanged, but frequency increases largely due to screening (breast cancer) and ambitious diagnosis as a result of that very screening. It doesn't, however, change the the statical outcome when removing the margin for pre-cancerous therapy that would never result in metastasis. So, the take-away? It definitely can't hurt to use this diet method; there is no harm and it could quite possibly cure you... who knows. There is no doubt that trans fats and artificial sugar are tremendously bad for you. All said, there should be funding for this type of treatment and research. "

"Now that pot is official legal and stamped without a doctor, the trains have a completely different scent in Denver."
"Not really an increase, since it was so prevalent before. However, previously people mostly smoked on the street or at home, whereas now they are finishing joints as they walk on the train. It just smells more."
"Matt, it smells like tax revenue and the loss of billions of tax dollars being dumped down the drain."
"It's like smokers getting in your car. It's just more discretionary than previously. I doubt more people are actually using. I bet usage of residents, not tourists, actually goes down over the next year. Tourist usage will go way up."
"Which is fine. Come to our state! Buy pot, stay in our hotels, use our airport; all have heavy tax on them."
"I will tell you that Denver did not feel the economic downturn like other parts of the country -- due in large to the huge amount of real estate being utilized by medical marijuana. That, and the city did a massive tech infrastructure in 2004."
"To your question, we've already saved a huge amount of money. In the past month, anyone that was currently being charged was released or dismissed (not currently incarcerated). Our incarceration rate is 564 to 100,000 residents -- much higher than the national average. 23% of those inmates are in for drug related charges, and of those 58% are in for a marijuana-related offense (72% of them are Triple-Strikers). It costs the state an average of $32,526/year to incarcerate someone. Our rate of incarceration is growing at about 3.8% a year (.97% if you count population growth). And if you're good at math, you know I just saved you a billion dollars in 16 months. Taxing it is also a good thing. As ""medicine"", the state wasn't able to collect excise on the substance... and let's be honest, it is ridiculously easy to get a card in Colorado -- actually, it was laughable. Even usage goes up slightly we end up massively ahead. To your national point, I'm not sure. But, I'd venture to guess that if you have desire to smoke pot, you are likely finding the means of consuming it. I, personally, believe everything should be decriminalized nationally, allowing states to make their own decisions. But, I'm a bleeding-heart Libertarian that wants the government to protect our borders and allow the states to operate as independent, voluntary Republic entities -- so, I'm not the norm."

These stories have often been poorly translated to the big screen, and now this. It looks wonderful -- story seems solid (from what I can gather in two minutes) and the acting is authentic (again, from what I can tell). It's just odd that I'd never buy a graphic novel or comic book, the grandfather of these stories, but I'll spend hard money to see this at a theater on opening night.  "

"I'm increasingly disappointed in the new Google TV, that I admittedly bought into the hype. Even with my discount, this upgraded box (Sony) has major issues and is simply priced too high. This box might work better for those that have cable and like talking to their TV to access DVR content. First, content is difficult to obtain, unless you live off Play, which most don't. The omission of Vudu and Hulu is almost fatal to this box. The flaws and clumsiness of the Droid OS shine more on your TV than mobile device. There is a high prominence placed on Chrome -- who cares, browsing the Web on your TV is useless and difficult. It took almost five hours for me to write an app that simply ports Vudu content and get on the box, but was met with quality problems and disconnections. So, 20/20, this box, which retails for $200, is terrible compared to the discontinued Sony Media box that sells for only $50 and has the ability to easily connect to Windows Media Center and iTunes without hacks."
"I'm going to disagree on the grounds of codex compatibility, apps and resolution. It's great that Apple (finally) added Hulu to the device, but their disregard in taking iOS apps into the Apple TV is a clear foreshadowing of a native Apple TV -- or blind negligence. Apple TV simply isn't versatile enough at this point. Locking into iTunes and their encoding has deterred me from an Apple commitment on the TV side of things. In the current evolution of digital content programming, agnostic compatibility is king. Three years down the road, there won't be boxes (of any kind), only screens -- so I just can't commit to a company that doesn't currently provide hardware natively -- and is largely opposed to partnership programs with technology companies that have saturated the market. This is already happening, so Apple has a small market entry point for hardware of this kind. 

This is the part where you tell me how the same would be true for tablet and phone markets that Apple turned upside down. Fair point, and I'll jump at the opportunity for Apple to do that at an affordable price (they just haven't yet)."

"Let's be honest, this is what's wrong with our world today. No, I'm not referring to youth acting in disrespectful ways. I mean the clash of technology in culture and society and the ability to persecute people for that very culture and expressionism. We, as a society, have lost something in this digital age. We've lost the ability to be human without judgement. Is this girl's photo offensive? Perhaps, to some or many, but among all our flaws, we've forgotten love and tolerance for other people. For a generation of the 60s, they seem to act as if social media is the silver bullet of prosecution. Fire her? I hardly think that is productive towards anything. What does that say about us -- as Americans, as a culture, as a loving society? Don't you think the feedback is enough; the response from society will eventually lead to positivity? 

http://mashable.com/2012/11/21/lindsay-stone-unpaid-leave-facebook-photo/"
"Yes, I sympathize, truly. It is a bold statement, likely meant to be an off colored joke -- and not intended to be broadcasted outside of her Facebook circle. As many can attest, I'm quite pro-military, and you punching her could have been the motivation to which I'm referring, but firing someone is not the response. That only teaches society that it is alright to fire people over statements or views that may be unpopular. This is the very thing you fight for, give your life for. Despite the disrespectful statement, we live in our country for love -- and to suppress any oppressing, communistic society that tries to take that away from us. Punching someone is easy, loving them when their flaws are exposed is the hardest thing anyone can do."
"In regard to the world issues, without question. ""Our world"", societally speaking, I'd argue not. I believe few people care or understand things outside their immediate city park or local murder. I think social media and technology has fundamentally damaged us. The irony, of course, is that I'm using that as a platform to make such a statement. That tick on the elephant's ass was the catalyst for what our generation founded as \b\ and 4chan and before that cDc because of these very things. These of course came together in the perfect storm that is Anonymous -- a largely negative, organic and raw force void of direction, mantra or identification. A group so large and powerful, they are able to alter politics, assist in the overthrow of governments and create mass havoc. It's very easy to ignore this as a figment... some mysterious illusion, but it's the causation of poor decisions like the mentioned. Anonymous was largely organized over a company wishing to fire employees of personal activities, specifically a opening gay man and his personal Hotmail account. This wasn't the only reason, but was the gasoline that launched the group into whatever it is now... which is to say, a random tornado capable of taking down governments."
"Agree, Rachel. You're in the military and you're conditioned and expected to react that way; and it is good that is the case."
"Scott, that's just not accurate. That's the equivalent of saying: ""Fuck it, prescribe all the antibiotics in the world because historically, on a tiny scale, bacteria has always had the ability mutate resistance."" The fact is most mobs don't have radical impacts historically (many just simply involve the death of the opposition), and moreover, they usually have a singular motivation or a line of accomplishment. Anonymous is a threat because it is agnostic to anything -- indiscriminate. There is no long-term goal. One month they attack gays, next they overthrow governments in Africa, and then next month pick on a religion for upsetting a couple members. To say something that powerful is simply the equivalent to dumping tea into the ocean is naive. This is a technology-dependent world, and in many ways the wars fought on the ground are far less important than power grids being taken offline, entire databases being stolen, communications halted, etc. If you'd like something more current, try their attack on Facebook one week for necessary layoffs at the failing company Zynga; and then two weeks later they are shutting down missile grids in Israel to protect Hamas. Hamas? Because they're saints, right? That is not a mob reaction. That is a cancer. Is it presumptuous of me to claim this all started as a reaction to not be persecuted for seemingly private communication? I don't think so. That was the flame that ignited the cancer without a cause. If you drill it down and remove all the bullshit, technology has changed humanity for the better and worse. I don't know where the balance is, but I've seen it get worse since social media and connectivity was born. Mostly because of two things, one of which is a causation of the other. 1. Social media isn't inherently social at all. It is mostly blurts of egocentric, self-motivated commentary. Everyone is guilty of this, myself included. 2. Humans act differently in social settings; there are different rules. Since social media is not social, most lean to narcissism and react in unloving ways. Social media some positive nature, in that you post photos of your kids and it brings a smile over great distance to a grandparent, but that's been around for decades and isn't really social as it is a benefit of a common connected network that is easy to use."

"So, for family and friends, here’s the nutshell version of the Greater Denver area. 

Observations:

1. Altitude sickness is largely gone at this point. Respiration is normalized and fatigue has decreased. 

2. It is oddly easier to fall asleep. I have completely kicked my Benadryl dependency

3. Marijuana is legal, and very accepted. By accepted, I mean, openly consumed in public and dispensaries seem to be more frequent than Starbucks.

4. Lower taxes make a difference, not only on income but day-to-day purchases

5. Housing prices are almost identical to St. Louis

6. There are more homeless people in Denver than St. Louis

7. Weather is erratic, but milder than the Midwest

8. The center of Denver is much quicker to get to from any direction, as it had sprawl in 360-degrees and is not bound by rivers or an ocean – originating far enough away from the mountains to accommodate development

9. You never have the “visor problem” as I call it. This is when you are driving west and the sun is setting so low that the visor becomes obsolete – and the sun blinds you. The mountains block this effect.

10. People here have a more pleasant and friendlier disposition and manner

11. “Real” cowboys do exist and they’re hardcore

12. Denver metro and Boulder might be the most liberal places I’ve ever been. Outside of Denver metro might be the most conservative place I’ve ever been.

13. Food Denver and Boulder is better than St. Louis, by in large. 

14. Downtown Denver is the best (in terms of commerce, cleanliness and activities) metro I’ve been to… hands down.

15. People here are notably more attractive here

16. There are more hippies here than in SFO

17. Art and music are a serious deal here… it is not to be taken lightly

18. The Rockies are amazingly beautiful

19. Layering clothing is absolutely necessary and becomes an art form 

20. People are very laid back, to the point that we waited for nearly 15 minutes for coffee in Boulder, without a single person even getting mildly frustrated. This would never happen in New York or even most other parts of the country. 

21. There are bike and hiking trails everywhere. I believe they may be more popular than the actual roads. Many people use them as directional references, like take the “blank” trail north to the “blank” trail south and you’ll be at IKEA

22. People are active ALL the time. 

23. The Sun is much hotter and more direct here. Sunscreen and lotion combination is very important. 

24. Vegans and vegetarians are very common, as are non-meat restaurants."
"No, we're a Republic. Popular vote is irrelevant. The people are represented by elected officials in a majority takes all in the state level. So, a Democratic vote in Texas is a waste of time, as is a Republican vote in California."
"Some could argue that a republic is a form of democracy. I'll buy that to some extent, but that's fairly loose. A better statement would be that through a republic state, we achieve a light form of democracy -- a vague interpretation of the power to the people."
"Democratic Republic is not accurate either. For example, in the case of a non-majority Electoral College for presidency, the decision is dissolved at one vote per state (the House), not the people. That makes us a Constitutional Republic, as in, popular vote never actually matters. Ever. A Republic is accurate and efficient. Your Pledge to the Country is to ""the Republic for which it stands"" -- freedom of the people is to be executed on our behalf, by the Republic, not by a larger group of fundamentalists or rich people or whatever. A Republic is stronger and less flawed than democracy. The downside, at least in our case, is what Kayce eluded. We have what we might consider a one-party system that we've grown into. Which is, what it is."
"Because the Constitution dictates process of election unevenly among the population in certain circumstances."

"OMG, code freeze."
"Looks like Amendment 64 has a likely probability of passing in Colorado. Win. I'm a fan of vice taxation."

"Fun.'s performance on SNL was amazing. Ruess has always been an awesome frontman, but that was great."
"Ah! It wasn't, now it is."
"Love that entire album. I hate his trench coat... what a goober."
"Interesting. Just watched a video Kaku released as to why we don't see aliens -- to which he proposes that organisms going from a Type 0 society to a Type 1 Planetary have an extremely high probability of destroying itself, thus it would never reach Type 2 of galactic expansion. Summing it, organisms migrate, then create culture, culture creates theology, theology breeds friction, life ends when life is capable of planetary suicide (nuclear bombs, biological, etc). I'm not a huge fan of Kaku, but I think this is an interesting concept, but probably too near-sighted... especially for a physicist."
"You have to veer a little when a company says they're the 'Best' at anything. Perhaps, even more so when the adjective in the actual company name itself. However, it turns out, this place is the 'Best' Indian I have ever eaten. Wholly fallen into the depths within the suburban Hell of a strip mall, it was absolutely wonderful food."
"grrrr, ebay."
"Always check that you have a clean towel before getting the shower. FML."

"Both are an adolescent throw-back for me... always wanted to see both."
"For the sake of argument, there is something to be said for drinking whiskey and listening to Cohen. Primus is great and has more energy... ok, Primus, but it going to be super packed."
"See, that's what I'm saying. Cohen is an icon. He's my Dylan (sorry, I always wanted to like Dylan and never could)."
"Hesitantly, I watched The Amazing Spider-Man this morning. It was on Vudu, and every so often a bad movie goes a long way, thus I clicked. I guess my preconceived opinion of the movie was based on the idea that a reboot was unnecessary (especially so soon, even for financial reasons) and the trailer looked like an underproduced version of the trilogy that I cringe at even to this day. But I actually loved this movie. It's no Batman reboot, but it was a nice piece of silk over a story most can recite without much help -- and probably more importantly, it felt sincere. Garfield and Stone feel real. The story feels more established and relatable. I'm not a comic book guy, but, like everyone else, I love a good, honest story and I feel this was one of them. Perhaps, maybe, a more veteran director could have made this movie go to the awesomeness level, but that mixed with Kevin Feige will brace a movie a little. All that said, give it a watch. It makes you wish you never saw Tobey Maguire anywhere near a Spider-Man movie. Well, you probably already felt that way, but this will help heal the wound."

"People that clap when the plane lands should be forced to stay in their seat until us normal folk can get off. You clap after a play, not after you flew a 40-ton piece of steel at 30,000 feet going 500 miles an hour. When you land, you just thank God you didn't die that time."

Clapping seems like an inappropriate response to someone that understands the physics of lift, drag and thrust. I'm not sure what the right response is, but for someone that is nervous flying into plain states because of a tilt-glide possibility, don't clap... it seems disrespectful."

"Denver is one of the greatest places in this country. Cities normally grind on me after a short period of time... like New York lost its appeal real quick for me, as did LA and even Phoenix. But, Denver hits you hard and continues to grow on you. I love St. Louis, though. It's very under appreciated. That said, Denver is simply way better for ""life"" and fun and balance -- with way less crime and much cleaner -- but less modern historical significance. Denver had the Arapahoe and cowboys when STL was building a trading hub and a brick downtown. So, it has far less historic buildings."
"Oh, and our baseball team isn't that good, but the Broncos are awesome."
"I love FC. It's definitely has a throw-back feel. Very laid back, much like the rest of CO. Someone that has lived here longer might be able to give you better insight, but think of a really big downtown Newburgh, with nice people, open ""usage"" policies and extremely close to the mountains. Denver is set back away from the mountains, whereas FC is exactly next to them. They have weirdest fucking lake I've ever seen. There is a walking/biking path about 2,000 feet up where you can look one direction and it's a cliff to downtown FC, look the other direction and you are parallel with a massive lake. It's like a giant natural dam. Never seen anything like it. FC is also much closer to Estes Park, whereas I'm a solid 1.5 hr drive. Huge plus. I'd go FC over Boulder, (some people commute) because it's a very nice place and you don't have the trustafarians like you do in Boulder (it's true, no one jump my ass over that). Ya, CO is awesome, though, and has jobs and peacefulness."
"It's about an hour drive up 25 from Denver proper, less (45-ish) if you live in north Denver and are close to 25. Longmont is nice (much smaller) and that'd be halfway, so 30 to Denver, 30 to FC. Kind of a biker (M.C., not the Armstrong kind) town mixed with hippie."
"Jarrod Holder and I were just in Nederland last weekend. Super hippie town, but that would be a commute to FC. Everything back in the foothills are old mining towns turned hippie awesomeness. It's the good kind of hippie community, not that bullshit you get in SFO. Any city on 119 or 72 is going to be awesome and beautiful (except for Blackhawk which is all gambling). Anything on 40 (West of the foothills) is tourists and snowboarders (Winter Park and Fraser). All the people in Fraser kept calling 119/72 ""crunchy"" -- we couldn't figure out what the hell they meant, and the people in those small communities are so nice, you don't want to ask... because I got the impression it was the snowboarder way of saying ""hippie"" negatively. Everyone's nice, though, even the snowboarder cities, and they really are just that."

"I don't believe that at all. No matter how thick your skin may be, losses hurt -- bad. And the more passionate you are, the harder they hit you as a failure. I don't give a fuck what kind of personality you have. The only difference is how you react to the fluctuation, and the endurance in which you can sustain substantial and repeated losses. At some point, you lose your baseline. Bogusky broke. Mun Tuck Wai snapped. It is simply human. In a state constant of perseveration, personality types do matter, but only slightly."
"Emotion is the root of attraction, so in that, I agree that they attract different types of people -- kind of. Neither side has any real conviction, each with their own struggle between complacency and ego (self-importance). At the end of the day, every person and every company is motivated by a selfish identification, so attraction is really just some immediate, evolving idea that has no long-term benefits.  I'll also argue this same point with interpersonal and romantic relationships."

"Romney wants to ""reduce or eliminate"" tax deductions, exemptions and credits? There are so many things wrong with this idea I can't even begin to comprehend the negative impact. Those deductions and credits help the American people. They are there so someone can afford to have children, move across the country for a job, retire, get educations (Student Deduction -- dependent and sole-p), disasters (Casualty & Theft Loss Deduction), install energy-efficient utilities in their homes, medical expenses exceeding a percentage of income -- oh, and interest profits on your property. Lowering taxes by ""20%"" doesn't help anyone if we eliminate the motivations (education and energy conservation) and the safety nets (reproduction and medical disasters). If you flatten everything (even at a reduced tax rate), you expect everyone (the middle class) to manage their expenses in a very long-term style to achieve immediate or short-term fiscal life obstacles or incentives. Let's be honest, credit card companies thrive on the fact that Americans are incapable of doing this. The only people that benefit are the rich; those that can simply afford to pay OOP medical expenses, send their kids to Harvard without loans and don't worry about retirement. Furthermore, I'm pretty sure that Romney would never be able to achieve this based on the budgetary rules and regulations that all presidents much follow. Nevertheless, don't be sucked into the sparkle of ""lower taxes""."
"Inspiring words of wisdom on the ""Burn-and-Turn"" business tactic, or as it is now known ""The Pivot"". All of us have seen this make or demolish companies, but it's becoming so important in the post-digital age for companies to make dramatic change and communicate that change system-wide. And it's hard, as a business owner -- and most can't comprehend the emotions felt by senior management, to sit down and tell people that there is a new vision, a dramatic change, and it may or may not include you. That's rough. Some of the smartest people I know take this philosophy and internalize it; looking at the things that are working (happy or fulfilled) and failing (unhappy) and immediately make a major life change -- a pivot. Unfortunately, sometimes these people are seen as having a breakdown or erratic. Forgive me for sharing this, but I'm reminded of a CD that found out his wife was having an affair and his three-year-old son was actually paternally not his. He made dramatic life changes, widely broadcasted his reinvention on the Internet, that most identified as a collapse. But the truth is grey, right? He took a shitty situation and found the opportunity. It was hard, but he is much happier now (at least it appears so). "

"Google is a much different beast than Microsoft. MS is notoriously more interested in the suing and extermination of companies (especially those that simply appear to be a threat, even remotely, in a vertical or product -- you should search how many companies under 1,000 they've put under in a matter of weeks; they are ruthless), whereas Google is always interested assimilation and acquisition. Huge difference in mentality. And, more importantly, 1 billion people over what timespan? Because most of Google's products do not touch 1 billion in an entire year. As reference, the entire fucking worldwide Internet is roughly 1.5 billion people with cellular included, and the only ""products"" that do that kind of UVs in a year are Amazon (B2C/B2B combined) and Google Search. So, the 1 billion mark would likely exclude most of Google's offerings, even over their entire lifespan... also considering China being mostly excluded from Google products (except Mail and Search). Sorry, Google Drive does not touch 1 billion, nor does Google+ (not even close). Facebook, just recently, touched 1 billion and it was considered an Internet milestone."

"""For employees in the Denver area, when relocating from other parts of the world with lower altitudes, please increase your water intake X3 and restrict alcohol and salt intake.

For example, the US Army allows eight weeks for transfers to adjust before they are physically tested.

"I would give a kidney for Shake Shack right now."
"Ooooooh, you have come to the right person. I assume you'll be on the island. Shake Shack is a must. I prefer the one near Wall Street (nice, new modern design) or the one in Times is also fairly nice (more seating), though they are all over New York. It is heaven. Every time I order the double, cheese fries (curry) and a chocolate milkshake. The creator is from STL. I really like 5 Napkins (the Kitchen area), too, for burgers, even though it gets a bad reputation. Pure Thai (in the Kitchen) is my all time favorite in the country. Total hole-in-wall, but amazing... curry puffs are to die for. Steak is tougher. Many New Yorkers love Club A, and it's good, but Smith and Wollensky is still my favorite. While Chinese food is everywhere, my favorite is Prosperity (Chinatown) or Yo Hip (Financial District). The Village area is too much for me to list... good food everywhere, though much more pubs with good food. Eleven Madison (Flatron -- and next to an outdoor Shake Shack) is probably the best food I've ever had... ever, but is expensive. Expect to drop a solid $20+ per person. If you're in the Village or Chelsea, my usual is food at Frankies 570 and then next door is a quiet drink spot called the White Horse. Italian is obviously not hard in Manhattan, but In general, I prefer food Brooklyn. That said, Carmine's (Times) is actually very food. No local will won't to go there, but I love it. Really, you can find good food anywhere on the island, it just depends on where you'll be. Areas that I like to eat are the Kitchen, then Meatpacking District/Village and the Upper East Side (be careful, there is a lot of crap food in the UES). If you'd like more unique experiences, the PDT is where I take visitors for the first time. The food is limited to hotdogs, but they are very good. PDT stands for Please Don't Tell. It's in the East Village (which also has good food) off St. Mark's. Go past the hotdog facade and follow the signs to the restrooms. There will be a phone booth. Pick up the phone and dial 660. The guy will tell you if they'll full or not. If not, the back side of the phone booth will open up and you go in. The more unique stuff is in Brooklyn, but things like the Meatball Shop (amazing, but every time I go the line is out the door) and Porchetta are out there in abundance. I can go on, but hands down, the Kitchen has the best worldly food money can buy. Some things are enthnicity-based, so watch for strange Russians in suits standing outside the front... that usually means you need to actually be Russian. Cambodian, same thing. If it's slow, they'll let you in, but usually not so much. The only exception are the Indian joints in that area -- they linger outside, but it's just something they do. Also, if a waiter is panning you in from the sidewalk, don't eat there. That's usually a dead giveaway that it is shit... and the Kitchen's proximity to Times makes it an easy target for the 'eating here only once' crowd."
"Oh, and stay away from Times. It is the absolute shittiest place on Earth. The best shopping are street fairs, the subway (bring cash and don't ask questions -- yes it is real), SoHo and NoHo. Brooklyn also."

"Very interesting"
"Check out Jacob Hawkins' site!"
"Expensive, but amazing. August Sturm"
"Ivan Perez-Armendariz gives an honest, straight-forward response to how digital fits into agencies. Oh, and best of all, the answer is obvious -- which makes you wonder why so many agencies struggle with something most of us feel is so simple."
"I want these"
"No huge surprises on BusinessInsider's 2013 top tech city ranking for professionals. Following the Outer Belt: Seattle, Portland, Denver, Salt Lake City, Boulder, Austin. The Eastern Belt: Baltimore, White Plains, Richmond, Raleigh-Cary, Charlotte, Jacksonville (what?), Pittsburgh (again). Every year the entire country wants Philly to take out Pittsburgh... but we are always disappointed. The only huge surprise is Orlando and Honolulu made the shit list and Phoenix didn't make the top city list (but they're still on the YoY growth Top 20 -- ya, I don't understand that either). Welcome aboard, Orlando and Honolulu! Don't worry, Detroit managed to make it out of the bottom two years ago, so there's hope."
"New Idea: Invent a device that will make all lawyers disappear."
"Oh, this is going to happen in some awesome form of SaaS. All lawyers will soon be working for Legalzoom.com."
"I'm going to invent something better than legalzoom... it will involve holograms."
"I'm going to wing it."
"What if technology is really the antagonist in this story? Doesn't it feel like some kind of anachronism to human history -- constantly chipping away at our own ethos? I had similar thoughts when I was working in advertising (the real kind). I justified it through commerce: lying, preying, fabricating cognitive dissonance of the measurable victims that saw my commercial and bought more things creates more jobs (trucking, warehouse, manufacturing, etc), whether they could afford it or not. But often, I feel some ideas in tech, though popular, are largely self-defeating. And by this, I mean that 92% of my conversations this month either started digitally or ended up digitally (I measured), relative to the topic. I've obviously been drinking."
"True, but I made 103 hand written flyers that I posted on telephone polls across the Greater St. Louis area."
"""Breaking News: Most things on Kickstarter are useless crap"""
"I just got my first flu shot. Learned my lesson last year."
"Go to Netflix and watch Happy (New Arrivals). Coming from someone that lost his own truth, this is a very confirming, enjoyable movie. You'll like it, too... even if you're already awesome."
"God help us all..."
"lol, super clever. I like clever people. I dislike camels."
"F$ck, I do not care if you pre-ordered an iPhone 5; stop posting about it. If you dropped cash on that, you're throwing away your money. Statistically speaking, if you're an early adopter, you likely already have an iPhone -- which means you are paying a lot of money for some upgrades that are already available for other devices. If you're an iOS fan-boy (like me), you're already getting a new phone with iOS 6, so... enjoy your letter boxing (large black sides) on all your apps."
"I mean, maybe. More important, apparently, you can sell pork and beans at a five-star restaurant. LTE is a high price to pay for short-term benefits. Provided you use your phone for large streams and downloads, and not your tablet, I could see an argument for, say, a photographer without an iPad or laptop -- or a great necessity for mobility without a cellular tablet. And, provided you are even in a city (AT&T only has like 50 or 60 total metros) that is on the grid (and provided those metros don't offer free WiFi, such as Denver, SFO, Chicago or St. Louis), then maybe there is some benefit to the grid that came online two years ago. And, if you are also willing to pay the large data surcharge for 4G, I get that, too. It will suck the shit out of your battery, much like MS Exchange forces a charge at least once a day... if not twice. All in, LTE will only benefit a small percentage of people. Long-term, I personally don't need the speed on my phone (I use it for apps, SMS, email... and, ironically, calling people) and I think LTE has peaked already in its life cycle... there is already new tech that is blowing evolution off the map using existing grids that are built (much in the same way AT&T found a way to pipe mass data on old telephone wires with U-verse). 

iOS 6 will be great, and I get the financials of dud product throws, but two in a row is a death blow. This phone is a massive bore. ""Sold Out""? Really? Is Gates in charge over there now? Are we just going to be served shit and take it."
"Totally. No question, but that's a provider service based on contracts, not a hardware advantage. Your situation, and I agree Sprint's 3G is really only 2G, is related to things outside of Apple. I, on the other hand, am pissed not to see something unforgettable after that 4S thing that happened."
"My kids have been in timeout a combined 16 times today."
"""No, the middle-class is $200,000 to $250,000,"" Romney responded. HH or per person? Either way, are you people fucking crazy? Nevermind the fact that the average household income is $50,000/yr in this country, but I don't know very many people in that range that are NOT in a C-level or partnership situation. I have a hard time swallowing that is defined as ""middle-class"". Maybe the West Coast, but even then... doubtful. And just to put this in perspective, a doctor (GP) with 10-years experience in a medium-sized operating umbrella can expect to make about $130k in St. Louis. After he/she gets done paying insurance, it's more like $110k. So, middle-class would mean you'd need two GP physicians working in the same household to be considered middle-class. Am I missing something here?"
"I mean, I feel I'm fairly well off... and I'm grateful for that (I've also sacrificed nearly every aspect of my life and bled out of every orifice to achieve that for more than a decade), but those numbers are nowhere near reality. If you are pulling down that type of money (in 99% of America), you have two houses (or one really big one), multiple new cars and the word ""budget"" is more of nice-to-have. That is the definition of upper-class. If you make $350k a year, you aren't upper-class, you're just fucking rich. You are making in one month what the average American makes all year."
"Bradley Allen Maglinger shared David Straw's photo."
"I just watched the Apple announcement. Even though the stock doesn't reflect it, I'm very pleased to have dumped my stock in July. 'Hey, look, our phone is now comparable to a Samsung from 2011.' They made the screen bigger and gave it LTE... really? HD voice... where have I seen that before? Oh, and fuck your adaptor accessories, they are now trash. I'm not hating; I just think it is the absolute minimum they could have done to stay relevant. What a headache."
"No, you know what, fuck this. I've waited too long for them to rollout two dud phones In a row. iOS is amazing compared to the other platforms, but the hardware is beginning to push me away."

"Yep. In fact, I'm imagining this weird mix of hippies and rich people on Pearl Street -- where for a dollar apparently this guy will ""Knock out"" his friend. I did, in fact, have dollar. Turns out, the guy really will punch his friend for a dollar. Mind you, I did this in the name of social science. I think that's a success."

"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You mean to tell me there is a place in this country where you can grab a kayak or tube and go through white-caps in the middle of a city by walking out your back door?! And then a shuttle takes you back up to you house for another go? Oh, and it's surrounded by mountains. What kind of madness is this?"
"For $30, I could find a way to get this on a plane."
"Just as I am suspicious of Giuliani for the lack of homeless people in New York, I have deep concerns that the Rockies have made everyone over the weight of 165 disappear from Denver. Seriously, this is the city of skinny people. I'm on a mission to find someone overweight."

"Thanks, Memorial, for putting Evansville on the map."

"James, that's an expensive private HS, BTW. Their parents are super proud. The letter in the random mailbox thing isn't original either. They did that (back in my day) when girls got knocked up as a form of gossiping between parents. Too bad they missed the memo about this thing called the Internet and the ability to email things out by clicking a button. Fifteen year tradition, you say. Might I know some of the twisted gals that originated this stupidity? Probably. Side note, totally stoked that my hometown finally made it on deadspin. It's truly an honor; inevitable, though."
"Ya, fairly typical behavior from that school. I dated a few girls from there and it got weird."
